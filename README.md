# NLTK-Hands-On-Tutorial
 This is a hands-on [NLTK tutorial](https://github.com/hb20007/hands-on-nltk-tutorial) that I completed in Jupyter notebooks. NLTK is one of the most popular Python packages for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I code examples that cover the following topics:

1.2 Text Analysis Using nltk.text &mdash; Extracting interesting data from a given text

2.1 Deriving N-Grams from Text &mdash; Creating n-grams (for language classification)

2.2 Detecting Text Language by Counting Stop Words.ipynb &mdash; A simple way to find out what language a text is written in

2.3 Language Identifier Using Word Bigrams &mdash; State-of-the-art language classifier

3.1 Bigrams, Stemming and Lemmatizing &mdash; NLTK makes bigrams, stemming and lemmatization super easy

3.2 Finding Unusual Words in Given Language &mdash; Which words do not belong with the rest of the text?

3.3 Creating a Parts of Speech Tagger

3.4 Parts of Speech and Meaning &mdash; Exploring awesome features offered by WordNet
