# NLTK-Hands-On-Tutorial
 This is a hands-on [NLTK tutorial](https://github.com/hb20007/hands-on-nltk-tutorial) that I completed in Jupyter notebooks. NLTK is one of the most popular Python packages for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I code examples that cover the following topics:

* Text Analysis Using nltk.text &mdash; Extracting interesting data from a given text

* Deriving N-Grams from Text &mdash; Creating n-grams (for language classification)

* Detecting Text Language by Counting Stop Words.ipynb &mdash; A simple way to find out what language a text is written in

* Language Identifier Using Word Bigrams &mdash; State-of-the-art language classifier

* Bigrams, Stemming and Lemmatizing &mdash; NLTK makes bigrams, stemming and lemmatization super easy

* Finding Unusual Words in Given Language &mdash; Which words do not belong with the rest of the text?

* Creating a Parts of Speech Tagger

* Parts of Speech and Meaning &mdash; Exploring awesome features offered by WordNet
